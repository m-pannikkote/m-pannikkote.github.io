<!-- Radio galaxies, with their kpc-scale jets flowing out into space, are one of the most beautiful structures 
 seen in the radio sky. Based on the structures of their jets, these were classified as FR-I and FR-II according 
 to Fanaroff and Riley (cite). The differences can be clearly seen inside this image below, with FR-IIs having 
 much energetic jets compared to FR-Is. THe trend in luminosity from the center of the galaxy to the edges of 
 the lobes are the main distinguisher.
 
 But, now we have a new class of objects that don't fit in this category. Behold, FR-0s (link fr0cat)... These are just as 
 bright as FR-I, with similar spectral behaviour and host galaxy type (red elliptical galaxies--link hubble class), yet don't seem 
 to emit jets. FR-0s have a compact radio morphology and are abundant in the local universe. The question is what's 
 stopping them from emitting jets like FR-Is?  
 
 When a jet tries to make it out of a galaxy it faces many obstacles. Notably, resistance from the inter-stellar medium.
 If it isn't fast enough (powerful enough) it fails.
