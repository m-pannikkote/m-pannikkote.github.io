🎓 I'm a final year master's student in Astrophysics and Space Science through the Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters program ([EMJM-MASS](https://www.master-mass.eu/)).

🌌 My research interest lies in the evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and galaxies through cosmic time.

🔭 I'm currently working on my thesis at the [University of Rome Tor Vergata](https://www.uniroma2.it/),focusing on the late-time X-ray emission from tidal disruption events (TDEs) with data from the [Einstein Probe](https://ep.bao.ac.cn/).

💫 So far, I've worked on identifying [gamma-ray-emitting FR0 radio galaxies](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad00b5) at [IUCAA Pune](https://www.iucaa.in/en/) and investigating the radio variability of **z > 5 quasars** at the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA)](https://www.mpia.de/en), both using data from the [Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS)](https://public.nrao.edu/vlass/).
